> September 2020

**Sept. 12th:** I began the season 7 of an American TV show, *The 100*. It's the last season of the show so I'm not going to spoil anyone but to sum up, it's about the last people of the human kind who live on a spatial station called "The Ark" and 100 teenagers are sent to the earth to see if it's survivable because hundred years ago, a nuclear war decimated the planet.
I watch it in English with English subtitles since the 1st season. 

**Sept. 19th:** I watched the second episode of the 7th season of the serie *The 100*.

**Sept. 22nd:** I have downloaded an app called *BBC news*, my English teacher, Ms. Ingrid Lancker, told us to have it on our phone so we can discuss about news during the class.

**Sept. 26th:** Like almost every weekend, i watched another episode of the serie *The 100*, it's the third one.

**Oct. 03rd:** I saw the fourth episode of *The 100*.

**Oct. 10th:** I visioned the fifth episode of *The 100*

**Oct. 17th:** I watched the sixth episode but I felt asleep at the end, I might have to watch it again to understand what is happening in the next episode.

**Oct. 21st:** I saw a video on YouTube from the channel Kurzgesagt. The video was about drug war and why it is a failure. It was really interesting and I highly recommend you to watch it ! The channel is a channel about popularization of various subjects, itâ€™s an English channel and has over 13 millions subscribers!

**Oct. 24th:** This time, I did not watched an episode of the serie but I watched a movie on Netflix called *Back to the futur*, in English of course. It is a really good movie and a famous one ! I don't think that I have to explain to you what the movie is about.

**Nov. 1st:** I watched *Back to the futur II* on Netflix.

**Now. 2nd:** I watched *The Warrior Kingdoms of the Weaver Ant* of the channel Kurzgesagt. A really interesting video about war in the kingdom of ants!

**Nov. 6th:** I did a quiz on Quizlet about keypoints in Unit 2 of the MCSE.

**Nov. 14th:** I set up my social networks in English.

**Nov. 21th:** I watched *Wild wild west*, it is a comedy movie starring Will Smith.

**Nov. 28th:** I watched *The 5th Wave*, it's a film based on the novel of the same name by Rick Yancey.

> December 2020

**In december**, I did not really have time to practise my english because examens were coming and I needed to focus on them.

But overall, I hope everyone reading my blog had a great time for Christmas and the new year's eve despite of the virus !

> January 2021

First of all, Happy new year ! 

Secondly, like I said in december, I had to study for my examens so I did not pratice much my English but I had an English examen too so I obviously studied for it in january.

**Jan. 11th & 12th:** I studied the vocabulary and the grammar for my english examen. I think I did well !

**Jan. 22nd (and the rest of the week):** Examens are finally over, I can take time for myself and relax, so I watched *The umbrella academy* on Netflix, in English with subtitles. It is a serie where people with superpowers have to save the world from the apocalypse.

**Feb. 1st:** Holidays are over and I begin with some English. An opportunity for me to get back into the swing of things.

**Feb. 06th:** I studied the vocabulary of unit 7 & 8 on Quizlet.

**Feb. 09th:** I started watching *Friends*, a very popular series with Jennifer Aniston. I watch the show in English with English subtitles.
