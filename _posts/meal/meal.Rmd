**Sept. 12th:** I began the season 7 of an American TV show, *The 100*. It's the last season of the show so I'm not going to spoil anyone but to sum up, it's about the last people of the human kind who live on a spatial station called "The Ark" and 100 teenagers are sent to the earth to see if it's survivable because hundred years ago, a nuclear war decimated the planet.
I watch it in English with English subtitles since the 1st season. 

**Sept. 19th:** I watched the second episode of the 7th season of the serie *The 100*.

**Sept. 22nd:** I have downloaded an app called *BBC news*, my English teacher, Ms. Ingrid Lancker, told us to have it on our phone so we can discuss about news during the class.

**Sept. 26th:** Like almost every weekend, i watched another episode of the serie *The 100*, it's the third one.

**Oct. 10th:** I visioned the fifth episode of *The 100*

**Oct. 17th:** I watched the sixth episode but I felt asleep at the end, I might have to watch it again to understand what is happening in the next episode.

**Oct. 21st:** I saw a video on YouTube from the channel Kurzgesagt. The video was about drug war and why it is a failure. It was really interesting and I highly recommend you to watch it ! The channel is a channel about popularization of various subjects, itâ€™s an English channel and has over 13 millions subscribers!

**Oct. 24th:** This time, I did not watched an episode of the serie but I watched a movie on Netflix called *Back to the futur*, in English of course. It is a really good movie and a famous one ! I don't think that I have to explain to you what the movie is about.
