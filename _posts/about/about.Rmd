Hello dear readers! My name is De Tandt Bastien! As part of my english course given by Ms. Ingrid Van Lancker, i have to present to you a topic related to my studies which is bioluminescence.

But first let me introduce myself ! 

I'm in second bachelor's degree in biology, i have chosen biology because life surrounds us and i'm passionate by studying it. I don't know yet what to do as work after university, there are so much intersting subjects in this discipline. I could become a zoologist, botanist, or i could study single cells, bacteria, viruses and so on.

Next to my studies, i do combat sports and sometimes i walk my dog on the little hill near my house, it helps me to relieve all the stress that i acculumate with the work at school.

This blog will help me to improve my english and informatic skills and i hope that this short introduction pleased you and has made you want to continue browsing this blog !
