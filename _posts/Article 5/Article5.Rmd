| General topic                         | A new fossil, preserved in amber, of bioluminescent   beetle have been discovered.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Procedure/ what was examined          | They examined the fossil of the beetle.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Conclusions/ discovery                | Beetles were capable of producing light 100   million years ago.     This fossil will help to understand how   bioluminescent beetles evolved and how to classify them.     Light is used to ward off predators and to   locate mates.    |
| Remaining questions                   | /                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
