| General topic                             | The discovery of a gene that may be the reason of the glow of pyrosomes                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure/ what was examined              | They captured pyrosomes and they sequenced the RNA of the organisms                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Conclusions/ discovery                    | The discovered gene, when mixed with coelenterazine, produces light                                                                                                                                                                                          |
