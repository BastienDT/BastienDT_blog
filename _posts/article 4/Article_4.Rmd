| General topic                     | A new technique has been developed to detect DNA break repair using bioluminescence.                                                                                |
| Procedure/ what was examined      | They have luciferases to detect the two major pathways of DNA double stranded break repair in cancer cell.                                                          |
| Conclusions/ discovery            | They have used their technique to detect altered dynamics of DSB repair and to discover HDR-suppressing functions of anticancer cardiac glycosides in human cancer. |
| Remaining questions               | /                                                                                                                                                                   |
