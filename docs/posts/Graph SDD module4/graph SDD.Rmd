```{r setup}
SciViews::R
```

```{r}
data <- read("urchin_bio", package = "data.io")
```

```{r}
?urchin_bio
```

```{r}
height <- 0:3
digestive_tract <- cumsum(rnorm(4))
urchin_bio <- data.frame(height, digestive_tract)
  ggplot(data, aes(x = height, y = digestive_tract)) +
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)
```

By relating the weight of the digestive tract in y to the size in x, the graph shows that there is some correlation between these two factors. When the height increases, the weight of the digestive tract increases too.
